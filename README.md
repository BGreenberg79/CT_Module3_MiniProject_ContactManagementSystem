# Contact Management System
## Programmed by Benjamin Greenberg
Mini-Project for Coding Temple

____
## Project Overview
The Contact Management System is a python program that will allow users to input and validate contact information for their network, allowing users to store the phone number, name, email, and any additional information the users may feel is relevant in a nested python dictionary data structure. Users can export their dictionaries into a .txt file to create a backup of their inputs and can also import .txt files into the program.
